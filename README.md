Hi guys, my name is Matheus, i live in Santa Rosa do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil. I'm Developer Mobile, working as a programmer using Js and its frameworks. I already studied react native, but flutter is awesome. My first contact with programming occurred at the beginning of my graduation in 2018 at [ULBRA](https://www.ulbra.br/torres) where I am until the moment, and where I learned languages â€‹â€‹like Js, C++, Java and Kotlin.
My favorite hobbies are codes :blush: :computer: :iphone:, watching matches of CsGo :anger:, cryptocurrencies, and playing CsGo :video_game:
